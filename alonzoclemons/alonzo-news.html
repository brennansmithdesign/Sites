      <div class="posted-date">Posted on September 28, 2016</div>
      <p>Several years ago, Alonzo's life-sized Arabian foal, Cassie, was purchased for placement at KidsPark, a disability-accessible play area at Lafayette Elementary School. Ultimately, for several reasons, the sculpture could not be placed in the schoolyard. But Alonzo's PATH partner, Jay Ruggeri, has really taken on the cause of a public placement for Cassie with the Lafayette Public Arts Commission. He hopes to tie in such a placement with Alonzo's broader involvement with the elementary schools in Lafayette. Stay tuned for future news about this effort.</p><a class="btn w-button" href="/pdfs/Alonzo_s-News-6.pdf">Download Newsletter</a>

      <h3 class="news-title-link">Why Alonzo’s Sculptures are Cast in Bronze</h3>
      <div class="posted-date">Posted on August 21, 2016</div>
      <p>One of Alonzo’s new friends asked a question that I had asked over 20 years ago, “Can I buy a sculpture that has not been cast in bronze?”</p>
      <p><strong>Nancy Mason wrote this reply –</strong>
        <br>Alonzo, of course, creates all these sculptures using clay or a wax/clay mixture. Then a mold is made from his model, and then it goes to the foundry for casting.</p>
      <p>The reason we are unable to sell any of his original models is that they have no inherent permanence. Most of the sculptures he makes are unable to stand on their own, as he typically uses only a minimum of armature, or interior structure. In addition, over time, the oils in the clay often "sweat" out to the surface, where they collect any piece of dust in the area, or else the surface of the piece dries out and flakes. And finally, the limbs, horns, tails, etc. of a sculpture bend and break off easily, and the surface is easily marred.</p>
      <p>The mold made for the casting is the exact representation of the work Alonzo did, and he is also in the habit of going to the foundry to check the first wax casting that is done from the mold, to make sure it looks as he intended.</p>
      <p>Once the mold is made, it may be used repeatedly, up to the edition number that is originally set (Tony Joe, like most of Alonzo's sculptures, is in an edition of 30, meaning that is the maximum number of times that sculpture will be cast).</p><a class="btn w-button" href="/pdfs/Alonzo_s-News-5.pdf">Download Newsletter</a>

      <h3 class="news-title-link">A Lion for Lyons</h3>
      <div class="posted-date">Posted on June 5, 2016</div>
      <p>A wonderful opportunity has arisen for Alonzo, as he has been commissioned to create a mountain lion sculpture for Lyons Elementary School. Teacher Mr. Timothy Ambrose tells how this project came to be:</p>
      <p>"From September through December 2015, Lyons Elementary School 5th grade students studied human rights. They read novels with characters who had disabilities and who experienced injustices, while building empathy. They studied injustices in slavery and read stories about African American history. Rex Peoples from the Colorado Blues Society visited and discussed these important topics and told stories through blues music, continuing to build empathy. They read and interpreted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, examining each article. The final visit for the 5th grade human rights project was from Alonzo, who has visited the school previously as well. The students learned about Alonzo's background and savant syndrome, and watched him demonstrate his sculpting. Alonzo's message and presence resonated with this class in a powerful way.</p>
      <p>The day after Alonzo's visit, they began to meet in groups on their own. Then they met with teachers, our principal, and parents, trying to see if they could raise money for a mountain lion sculpture as a legacy project for the school. It was important to them to become a customer of Alonzo's art, because during his presentation, he told them that one of his goals is to have lots of customers. The 5th graders prepared and shared a presentation with the PTO as first steps for fundraising and reached out to the community for support. After many months of planning and organizing with community, family and PTO assistance, the 5th graders raised money to become a customer, and commissioned a 14-inch long sculpture of a mountain lion for the school as a legacy project."</p>
      <p>Alonzo has been perfecting his mountain lion. Soon it will go into the production process, turning his wax/clay model into a bronze sculpture. It should be ready for presentation to the school in the fall.</p>
      <p>The whole connection of Alonzo with Lyons Elementary School has been beautifully facilitated by friend and PATH partner Robert Boggess.</p><a class="btn w-button" href="/pdfs/Alonzo_s-News-4.pdf">Download Newsletter</a>

      <h3 class="news-title-link">Alonzo's School Presentations</h3>
      <div class="posted-date">Posted on April 14, 2016</div>
      <p>Alonzo enjoys demonstrating his sculpting abilities for school groups and other audiences, as long as these events are not too frequent. He is accompanied by his assistant, Nancy Mason, or another friend, who tells some of Alonzo's amazing story as he sculpts one or more of his animal figures.</p>
      <p>The effect of meeting Alonzo and observing him "doing his thing" can be profound for many in his audiences, and can act as ripples spreading outward on a pond.</p>
      <p>A teacher who hosted Alonzo invited a certain parent to attend; this parent had been very opposed to the integration of children with disabilities into her child's classes. She left the presentation with tears in her eyes.</p>
      <p>While Alonzo was at the grocery store one day, a young man approached him. "I remember you; you came to my school many years ago. Meeting you inspired me to follow my own dream to become a dancer." And he broke into a little jig for Alonzo, right there in the aisles.</p>
      <p>The fifth-graders in one class that met Alonzo were assigned to write a paragraph about their impressions. A number of them made comments such as: "Now I'll think differently about my (cousin, neighbor, etc.) who has a disability."</p><a class="btn w-button" href="/pdfs/Alonzo_s-News-3.pdf">Download Newsletter</a>

the Plains</h3>
      <div class="posted-date">Posted on March 25, 2016</div>
      <p>Alonzo named this bison “King” or “King of the Plains,” thinking of it as the father of his cast sculpture, “Prince of the Plains.”</p>
      <p>Alonzo has done a number of school presentations at Lyons Elementary School, and because they are the “Lyons Lions,” he made this sculpture thinking of them.</p>

      <div class="posted-date">Posted on March 8, 2017</div>
      <p><strong>The Man in the Moon</strong>
        <br>Unique among Alonzo’s creations, this fanciful sculpture shows a new twist on an old theme. Why wouldn’t the face be on the outside rather than the inside of the arc?</p>
      <p>Alonzo is continually working on his art. During the cool seasons, when he focuses on sculpture, he will often produce a piece per weekend. Only a small number of his wax/clay models can be cast, but more of these will be shown here, and casting of a particular sculpture is possible if interest is expressed. Let us know!</p>
